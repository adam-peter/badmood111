          Really. Tinkering with technology was one of my deepest passions ever
          since childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building legos, reading tech magazines and repairing (read: breaking
          functional) electronics was a daily ocupation of mine.
        </p>
        <p>No wonder I decided to become a developer.</p>

          Operating and scaling online businesses allows me to provide leveraged
          value to a large population and **impact millions**.
        </p>
        <p>
          With extensive education and experience in management, copywriting,
          and selling in general, I have worked on numerous professional
          projects, mainly concerning web application development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether working solo or as part of a team, in a personal or enterprise
          setting, I have honed my skills and gained valuable insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to ballance my love for technology with my burning desire to
          make a difference in the world. That desire, I portray through
          entrepreneurship.

          My grandfather taught me to read when I was 4 years old. Iâ€™ve been
          reading everything that caught my interest, until I developed a love
          for reading itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet only sped up my self-education. I've taken countless
          programming courses and built my own projects, teaching myself
          software engineering without ever touching the subject in school.
